How to use the log:
	- write down what you worked on (with enough detail so others can understand what it was)
	- write down how long it took you to do what you were working on
	- be sure to clearly state your name

2017/03/18 - (~2.5 hours) Introduced Fragments to reduce duplicated code in WatchedListActivity, SearchActivity, and CatalogActivity. Because of the Fragment change some XML files were no longer necessary and were replaced with fragment_item_grid.
NOTE: Be sure to carefully look over how the fragments are used and the need to implement ItemGridController if you want the fragment to call the activity back for item presses. (Denis)
